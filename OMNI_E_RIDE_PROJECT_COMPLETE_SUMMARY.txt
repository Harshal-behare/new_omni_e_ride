1) Complete project overview and business purpose
The OMNI E-RIDE project aims to innovate electric mobility by providing a comprehensive platform managing customer interactions, dealer networks, and detailed analytics.

2) Detailed description of all implemented pages and their functionality
- **Home Page**: Contains sections like Hero, Featured Models Carousel, Why Choose Us, Dealer Locations, and Testimonials.
- **Dashboard**: Displays user-specific data like Orders, Test Rides, and Quick Actions.
- **Admin Page**: Includes analytics such as Total Users, Monthly Revenue, and System Uptime.
- **Dealer Dashboard**: Shows dealer-specific metrics and transactions.
- **Login and Signup Pages**: User authentication interfaces allowing log-in and registration.

3) Complete listing of all components and their purposes
Components range from UI elements (like OmniButton, Cards) to functional blocks (warranty management, calculators) enabling modular design and reusable code.

4) Current system architecture and technology stack
- Frontend: React and Next.js with TypeScript. UI with Tailwind CSS.
- Backend (Simulated): Auth and data managed within components, demo usage with local data stores.

5) User roles and access control system
Roles include Customer, Dealer, and Admin, managed via a demo authentication provider.

6) Data models and entities structure
Key models include Customers, Dealers, Orders, Test Rides, and Warranties, with their attributes.

7) All forms and their fields
Includes forms for signing up, test ride booking, dealer applications with validation.

8) Navigation structure and user flows
Intuitive flows guiding users through the siteâ€™s functionalities with a consistent header and footer.

9) Current implementation status
The platform's user interface is mostly implemented, simulating user interactions with the existing UI and data models.

10) Backend integration requirements and API endpoints needed
Backend integration needed for persistent data management, authentication, and business logic.

11) Database schema recommendations
Recommend using NoSQL for flexibility in handling dynamic data structures, especially for user and transaction data.

12) Authentication and security implementation details
Demo authentication with local storage; secure, scalable authentication system required for production.

13) File structure and code organization
Organized modularly by features and utility with separation of components, pages, and logic.

14) Dependencies and third-party libraries used
Utilizes libraries like Radix UI for accessibility, React Hook Form for form management, and Lucide Icons for consistent styling.

15) Deployment and hosting details
Not yet deployed; intended for deployment on a scalable Node.js hosting platform.

16) Performance metrics and optimization strategies
Focus on lazy loading components, efficient state management, and streamlined styles.

17) Known issues and limitations
Demo user management and data operations are limited to client-side emulation without server communication.

18) Recommendations for backend integration
Implement RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints for handling data operations and user authentication securely.

19) AI-friendly suggestions for improvements
Future enhancements could include AI-driven features like proactive support chats or predictive user behavior analysis.
