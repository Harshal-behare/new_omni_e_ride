Updated scope (UI-only):
- Added About page.
- Completed Customer, Dealer, and Admin dashboards with sidebars, stats, and analytics (Recharts).
- Replaced Models listing with a stable version to avoid flicker/auto-close.
- Moved all booking/tracking interactions into dashboard areas; removed old public routes.
- Implemented Contact page with react-hook-form (UI only).
- Added DemoAuthProvider and RoleGate; wrapped app via layout QuickEdit.

Backend wiring (where to change):
1) Auth
- components/auth/demo-auth-provider.tsx: replace login() with fetch('/api/auth/login') and read/write secure HttpOnly cookies. Redirect based on server session.
- Gate access server-side for /dashboard, /dealer, /admin when real auth is added.

2) Leads & Contact
- Replace alert() calls in:
  - app/models/page.tsx (onLead)
  - app/models/[slug]/page.tsx inquiry form
  - app/contact/page.tsx form onSubmit
- Point to POST /api/leads and POST /api/contact. Store in DB + send email (Resend).

3) Analytics
- Replace lib/demo.ts with real queries. Feed charts in:
  - app/dealer/page.tsx
  - app/admin/page.tsx

4) Data fetching
- models data currently from lib/models-data.ts. Swap to GET /api/models and /api/models/[slug] (server components or route handlers) when backend is ready.

5) Env vars (server only)
- DATABASE_URL, RESEND_API_KEY, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY (for future maps), JWT_SECRET (or provider specific). Client-safe values must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_.

Removed files:
- app/test-ride/page.tsx
- app/order-tracking/page.tsx

Notes:
- Charts use "recharts" (auto-inferred). Keep it or swap later.
- Keep emerald theme cohesive in future additions.
- Add loading.tsx and error.tsx per route groups for polish.
